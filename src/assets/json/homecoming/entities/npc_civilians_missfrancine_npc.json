    "description": "Miss Francine is a plucky young teacher from Paragon City who came to the Rogue Isles to teach the underpriveliged. Somehow her sweet demeanor and good intentions caught the attention of several members of the Freakshow, who were so astounded that they couldn't bully her, decided to try doing what she said. She has since started an underground school dedicated to teaching and rehabilitating members of the normally violent street gang.",
