    "description": "Doc Buzzsaw makes no secret that she was once a disciple of Dr. Vahzilok, but had a falling out with her mentor some time ago. Afterwards she journeyed to the Rogue Isles to continue her research, and rumor has it, escape the retribution of the Vahzilok. The Freakshow came to her looking for someone who understood both cybernetic machinery and human anatomy well enough to repair them, and she quickly formed an association with them. The Freaks love the improvements 'Doc' makes for them, and Buzzsaw sees her energetic new allies as the perfect mix of protectors and test subjects. The fact that both sides are completely deranged only makes the partnership work better.",
