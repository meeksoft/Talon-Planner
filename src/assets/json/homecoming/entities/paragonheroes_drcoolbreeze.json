    "description": "Dr. Rufus Mustafa Jenkins was a brilliant cryogenic scientist in the 60's. He was making great strides in the area of cryogenic restabilization - so great, his work colleagues were jealous and framed him for an accident which resulted in the death of the teaching assistant assigned to help in the college lab where he worked.<br><br>Dr. Jenkins spent 30 years in prison for a crime he didn't commit - he now seeks to prove that he was framed and restore his name in the halls of academia. Before he went to prison he stashed all of his data on the new prototype 'cryo-gloves' he had been working on. Once released he retrieved his gear and now fights crime in order to restore his pride and finance his research.<br><br>All this would be much easier if he wasn't also the appointed guardian of his unruly triplet nephews per his good-for-nothing brother's last wish.",
