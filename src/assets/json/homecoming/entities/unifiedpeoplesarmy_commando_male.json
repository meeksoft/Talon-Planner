They were unphased when it was revealed that he had a mental disorder causing him to believe that Aurora Pena was his wife; what mattered was the goal of fighting for the freedom of a new tomorrow. They fight now in the Unified People's Army with the belief that they stand for the freedom of mankind, even if mankind doesn't realize it.",
