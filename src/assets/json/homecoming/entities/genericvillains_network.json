    "description": "Network started his 'career' as a bookkeeper for The Family, until a fateful day on which he came across a powerful 'information suit' while cataloging the contents of a 'recovered' cargo container. This suit tied his mind directly into information networks around the world, giving him the bandwidth to accumulate unmatched resources within the organization and make a real name for himself. Eventually, he came across information that made him look at his employers in a new light and reconsider his role with them. This discovery drove him to offer his services to Sgt. Schorr, the leader of the Hammers of Justice, an organization whose secrets he had already learned through the information acquired through his suit.",
