    "description": "A hero from the lost-age of Myth, the God-Champion constructed the Coliseum in time immemorial. Brooding like a spider in its web, the God-Champion has feasted on the sweet nectar of violence ever since. For generations, the God-Champion has waited for a challenger worthy of his power and has grown overwhelmingly more powerful with each combatant defeated on the brutal sands. Now that a group of challengers have proven themselves worthy, he takes up sword and shield once more as the souls of the vanquished flock to his side for a chance to bathe once more in the glory of the Coliseum.",
