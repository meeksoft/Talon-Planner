After the investigation concluded it was discovered that she had caused the fire when her powers manifested unexpectedly. Two people died in that building, and the courts ruled her innocent despite the tumultuous drama of the proceedings that left many raw. Unable to shake a sense of guilt and a driving need to ease her conscience, she joined Hero Corps to understand and control the power within her.",
