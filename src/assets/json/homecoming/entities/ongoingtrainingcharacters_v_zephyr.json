    "description": "Zephyr has been around for quite a while, zipping around the skies for generations. Having become rather bored due to the advent of increased navigation technology and sturdier construction material used in buildings, Zephyr has taken a corporeal form recently. Spending time among Paragon City, he would soon move onto the Rogue Isles where he found people were far more willing to destroy things for no good reason. And for Zephyr, that's one heck of a lot of fun.",
