    "description": "Brayden Doggett was just an average middle-class working fellow, coaching baseball on behalf of his late brother-in-law Steve. He owed it to his sister to stand in as a father figure to his nephew, and took up the job of coach to fulfill that promise and be a good role model to Bobby. Fate had other plans, though, and on the drive home from dropping Bobby off, he fell asleep at the wheel and crashed into the back of a tanker truck outside of Steel Canyon. To this day nobody has been able to determine what was in the tanker truck, despite multiple investigations. The results are unmistakable, however - Brayden now has the reaction speed of a cat and the strength of a bear. He joined the Hero Corps to show Bobby that great power should not be hidden, and now fights crime to set a good example.",
