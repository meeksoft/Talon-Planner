    "description": "A reclusive technophile, Splice's skill with a soldering iron has saved more lives than almost anyone else in the Resistance. She invented 'blueboxes', cheap home-made devices that allow the Resistance to send and receive messages over Praetoria City's power lines, known lovingly as 'The Static'. She's also pioneered a technique to allow cellular phones to function off the grid, a feat she boasts to have figured out in only five minutes flat.<br><br>Currently she's working on reprogramming captured clockwork androids. Of course, since the things pack dangerous weaponry the specimens her allies bring in for her are usually less than functional.",
