    "description": "Organized crime has always had plenty of competition in Paragon City, but that doesn't stop young street toughs from wanting to swear allegiance to their Don and live like a wiseguy. The Button Man Brawlers are amongst the toughest of the lower ranking Family thugs. They use stolen technology to make each of their punches hit like a ton of bricks. Their brass knuckles are also poisoned with a rare toxin. The Family only calls on these thugs when it's necessary, as they are normally away on important business.",
