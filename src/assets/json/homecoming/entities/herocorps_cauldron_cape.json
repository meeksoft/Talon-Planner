However, she delved too deeply into the lore behind Bog Bodies and the Cauldronborn, and was cursed by the Sidhe for treading too close to some of the sacred sites and learning their secrets.<br><br>Cauldron is now joined with Hero Corps to help remove her curse - and in the meantime trades her research skills and develops control over her curse to fight crime as payment.",
