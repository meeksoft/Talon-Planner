    "description": "From her broad smile and the splash of crazy in her eyes, to her dizzying speech pattern and signature pink PPD helmet, everything about Ricochet is memorable. She earned her name like most of the others do in the Crusaders: by how she got her first kill. In Ricochet's case, rumor has it, she let off a blind shot during her first engagement which ricocheted off of a PPD power field and ruptured a high pressure fuel tank. The resulting explosion took out the entire PPD squad, saving the lives of her comrades.<br><br>The other story is that the bullet ricocheted into her head.",
