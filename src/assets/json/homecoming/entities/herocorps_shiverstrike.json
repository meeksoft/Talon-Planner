    "description": "Arfaana Jafri is a natural born leader, a talent she inherited from her father, a rogue hero that took up the moniker of 'Chumur Deki' (The iron-legged steed of Chitrali folklore) to deter and eventually dismantle the illegal drug trades of his province. Deki recruited a small team of loyal warriors and would stalk the trade routes at night, all the while raising a family on the move. The life was not without its dangers, and when Arfaana came of age she was sent with her mother to the United States to continue the work abroad. She'd spent enough time at her dad's side to learn the skills, and blessed with mutant powers of her own, she began working under the name Shiverstrike and conducting global operations with Hero Corps.",
