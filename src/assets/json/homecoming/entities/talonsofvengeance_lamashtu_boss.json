    "description": "Lamashtu is the daughter of Anu, the Sky God. Rather than follow the will of the gods, Lamashtu's malevolence knows no bounds. Left unchecked she threatens to consume and destroy all life. It is for these reasons that Lamashtu was sealed within the Eternal Prison by the gods and the Furies centuries ago. She bears seven names and when called upon in incantations she manifests as seven witches. She is responsible for many of the woes of ancient times. Nightmares, death, plague, sickness, and the wholesale slaughter of men, women, children along with feasting on their blood and bones are all grisly examples of her work. Lamashtu has an enduring hatred for all of creation. It is not surprising then, that she is the mother of all monsters, including those first corrupt creatures which would one day be claimed as servants of the Furies.",
