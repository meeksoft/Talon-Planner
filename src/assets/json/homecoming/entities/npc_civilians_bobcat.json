    "description": "Created during the tail end of the Hamidon Wars, genetic hybrids were made by a variety of military and privately owned laboratories in an attempt to create super powered soldiers to fight the Devouring Earth. Bobcat is one such experiment that merged human and feline DNA. Left abandoned and forgotten after the war she eventually escaped from the lab and roamed the streets of Praetoria City until Neuron found her.<br><br>Initially feral and incredibly bad tempered, she quickly grew accustomed to civilized life. She has taken up a near permanent residence in Studio 55, using her influence as a Praetor's girlfriend to remodel the club as she sees fit.",
