  "display_help": "Spines protrude from your body and can deal damage in melee or at very short ranges. Spines are hollow and hold a neural toxin that deals additional Toxic damage and can Slow or Immobilize your enemies. The toxin is cumulative, and multiple hits will affect a target more strongly. Very few foes have resistance to Spine poison. Like all Stalker primary attack powers, Spine attacks can land a Critical Hit for double damage, if you are properly Hidden or if your target is Slept or Held.",
