    "description": "Lars Hansen has been the light keeper on Striga Isle for longer than most of his neighbors have been alive. He remembers what the island used to be like before the Council moved in: a little seedy, perhaps, but lively and full of hope. Nowadays, no one ventures near the lighthouse that is Lars' home, and he gets a little lonely from time to time. To stave away his sorrows, Lars bides his time by keeping a watch on Council activities. His attention has shifted to Port Noble in recent days, but he is still vigilant as ever.",
