    "description": "Each Capo controls his own crew of Button Men. It's a kind of authority you don't earn unless you've proven yourself both ruthless and lucky. Capos save the best weapons and women for themselves and are inevitably smart, tough fighters. These Capos have been given the honor of using stolen Praetorian technology, specifically the Resistance Heavy Barrels. The Family had a choice in the matter; they could take the Resistance rifles, or the Resistance Heavy Barrels. Once the capos saw the Heavy Barrel in action, their decision was a no brainer.",
