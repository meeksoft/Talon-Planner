    "description": "Iron Ellis is a decorated Hero Corps hero, having served in the first and second Rikti Wars and only being moved from his office in Galaxy City because it was literally bombarded with meteors. Ellis has been working quietly behind the scenes since the attack, issuing orders to other members and assigning contracts with ruthless efficiency. Many of his friends and co-workers worry that his carefree attitude was lost in Galaxy City, but the truth is he's never been more effective than he is today, in the wake of the disaster.",
