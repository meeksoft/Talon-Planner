    "description": "Jean-Pierre 'Malaise' Lourdin was not always a hero. He began his career as a villain in Europe, using the twisted images in his mind to commit robberies. With INTERPOL hot on his trail he landed in Paragon City, where his broken thoughts were detected by Sister Psyche. She confronted him and after an intense battle was able to subdue him. For years, he worked as a hero with the Vindicators, though many believed it was only a matter of time until his madness returned. They were, unfortunately, correct. Now, as his 'old' self, Malaise seeks to use his powers to terrorize those around him, all in the name of 'art', or so he claims.",
