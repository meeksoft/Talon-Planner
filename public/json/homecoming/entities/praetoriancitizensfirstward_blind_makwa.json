    "description": "Blind Makwa was born without sight like normal men. He was gifted with the rare and beautiful ability to see spirits as others see one another every day. It was this reason that he became a well respected medicine man. His ability to converse with those who had taken the heaven's road and joined with the great spirit was sought by many in the wake of the Hamidon Wars. But dead men are supposed to tell no tales, and so when Blind Makwa began hearing terrible truths, he snuck away to the First Ward where he would be safe, and no one would look for him.",
