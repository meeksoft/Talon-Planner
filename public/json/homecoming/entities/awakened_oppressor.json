    "description": "Oppressors are powerful and vengeful psychics who revel in enslaving lesser minds to their own. Close proximity to an Oppressor will cause short bouts of confusion in most subjects as their mind is slowly siphoned away and replaced with that of the Oppressor's. Their rage at being contained within the Seer Network has manifestation of corrupted flesh that wracks their bodies, resulting in their subsequent removal from the Network for safety reasons. Oppressors are thus without use in Praetoria, as the dangerous side-effects of prolonged exposure to the Seer network prevent them from remaining safely bound to it, and their desire to enslave the will of others makes them unfit for duty elsewhere.",
