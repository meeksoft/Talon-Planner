    "description": "Though initially cast for her physical assets in a number of 1960's 'rebellious teenager' movies, Maemae van Whooters soon cultivated a respectable career by alternating serious roles with B-movie fare to avoid typecasting. Her star fell in the late 1970s when changing standards of beauty in Hollywood made it harder for her to get major roles. Instead of giving up, she began to concentrate on serious parts in foreign films, earning high praise in Europe with several costume dramas through the 1980s. She quit acting in the mid 1990s to become a writer, though she will still appear on camera to promote children's charities and environmental organizations.",
