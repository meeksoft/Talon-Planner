    "description": "Alec Parson was once a senior forensic scientist working for MICIR, the Ministry of Information Criminal Investigation and Research, in Praetoria. He has a passion for robotics and all things Clockwork related. He helped Longbow mass produce their own version of Praetoria's Clockwork. In addition, Alec Parson has his own, personally built, Clockwork and rifle that he uses to defend himself and others. After seeing all the atrocities that were spread by the Clockwork in the Praetorian War, Parson believes that it's time to show the people the good that technology and Clockwork can do for the world.",
