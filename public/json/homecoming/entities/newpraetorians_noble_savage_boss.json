    "description": "After escaping Praetoria, the Noble Savage realized that he was free of the suffering that was his lot while within Praetoria. News of his good deeds throughout Praetoria filtered readily to the commission responsible for addressing the Praetorian refugees, and for once, he was welcomed openly. This, in turn, gave the Noble Savage a renewed purpose in life: to continue his role as leader of the Forlorn, using this force to aid in the defense of the world that welcomed him. Though not fully a member of the New Praetorians, he identifies readily with their aims and is willing to join them from time to time if called upon to serve, but generally he works on behalf of the people of Primal Earth.",
