    "description": "Twinshot wandered around the nation for several years after being discharged from the military, acting as a hired gun to whoever would hire her. After some time, she got over her disillusionment and remembered why she joined the military to begin with. She began fighting for 'what was right.' Working with Proton, they fought together to bring justice to Paragon City. Recently she's added Dillo and Flambeaux to the mix. Twinshot is always on the lookout for a fresh face who wants to make a difference.",
