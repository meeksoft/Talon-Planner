    "description": "Long Jack has worked the docks in Port Noble since he was a petty officer in the Second World War. He was training himself up to be a natural hero, but that wasn't in the cards. He lost his health  not to an accident or a disease, but to an unethical army doctor who used Jack's body for experimentation at the behest of the Council villain, Maestro. With the Council is tatters after the New Praetorians ran through them, Long Jack hasn't lost his purpose yet - he knows better than to let his guard down and has reason to believe fascism isn't done with Striga, yet.",
