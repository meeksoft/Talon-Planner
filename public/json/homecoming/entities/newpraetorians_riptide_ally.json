    "description": "Riptide was once a well known member of the Powers Divison within Praetoria. He was known as one of the few 'Top Dogs' who was not out for fame, but instead out to uphold his honor and serve his people. Riptide was arrested by the authorities in Paragon for his role in the attacks on Talos Island. It was only through the intervention of Provost Marchand that Riptide was released under his care. Marchand vouched that Riptide, for all that he did, was a soldier, and an honorable one. All Riptide needed was a commander whose honor matched his. The authorities agreed to allow Riptide out while under the careful watch of Provost Marchand. However, they warned that should Riptide, much like Marauder, do anything wrong, they would not hesitate to put him back in the Zig.",
