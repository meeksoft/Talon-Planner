    "description": "As one of the younger members of the Midnight Squad, Percy seems to get himself into a lot of trouble. Often acting before thinking through what he's doing or where he's going, he has a tendency to find himself strung up by one villain group or another. Thankfully, the Midnighters can spare a member or two for a rescue operation. Percy escapes the full wrath of the Midnight Club leaders because, while his risks seem rash, they often result in large windfalls of knowledge and lore for the Club.",
