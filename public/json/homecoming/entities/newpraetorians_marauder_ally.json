    "description": "Michael White grew up with one rule: the strong make the rules. He was once a Praetor within Praetoria, but that all came crashing down during the Praetorian War. He attempted to hold the line in the battle for Lambda Sector with the support of Praetor Berry's 'super serum'. White was defeated and forced to retreat. He found out later that Berry's serum came at a grave cost; his strength and stamina were both sapped from him; White could barely run twenty feet without getting winded. Provost Marchand and a super powered individual rescued White from the clutches of Hamidon and White was put under Provost Marchand's care for probation. Michael White defected to the Council to have his abilities restored, then delivered key information to Provost Marchand, revealing that he was merely using them for his own gain. Michael White is now a member of the New Praetorians, though he knows that he is one move away from being placed in the Zig.",
