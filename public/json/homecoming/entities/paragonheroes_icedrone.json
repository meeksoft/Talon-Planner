    "description": "Icedrone was a brilliant mechanic who had a project on the side - the creation of super-powered gloves that could control ice.<br><br>He was forced to use a prototype version of his gloves when the Hellions attacked his shop one day. The shop burned to the ground, but Icedrone was able to defeat the Hellions. Icedrone abandoned his career as a mechanic that day to take up fighting crime in Paragon, though he has been known to let his own political views get in the way of his crime-fighting.\"",
