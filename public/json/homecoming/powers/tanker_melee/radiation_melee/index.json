  "display_help": "You are able to harness the power of Radiation to crush your foes in close quarters. Radiation Melee attacks have a chance to inflict the Contaminated state on a target for a moderate amount of time. Powers that deal greater damage, have a longer recharge time and animation time have a greater chance to inflict Contaminated. Hitting Contaminated targets with Contaminated Strike, Radioactive Smash, Radiation Siphon and Devastating Blow cause a portion of that power's damage to also hit nearby foes. Radiation Melee attacks primarily deal smashing and energy damage, but this set is also capable of dealing some toxic damage.",
