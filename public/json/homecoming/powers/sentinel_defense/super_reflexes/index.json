The type of weapon or attack used against you is irrelevant. So swords, bullets, fire, energy, even Psionic Attacks can be avoided. Super Reflexes focuses on different techniques. Avoiding melee attacks is different than avoiding ranged attacks or even area-of-effect attacks. Your weakness is your opponents accuracy.",
