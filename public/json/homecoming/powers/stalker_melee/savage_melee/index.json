Savage Strike, Maiming Slash, Shred, Assassin's Frenzy and Savage Leap all grant stacks of Blood Frenzy. Each stack of this buff grants a small recharge buff and endurance cost discount. You may have up to 5 stacks of Blood Frenzy active at a time. Blood Frenzy can be maintained, or it can be consumed to empower Rending Flurry, and Hemorrhage. Using one of these consumers while you have 5 stacks of Blood Frenzy offers an additional benefit to these powers, but will also leave you Exhausted for a short time. While Exhausted you cannot build Blood Frenzy.",
